# ufo_analysis

Description: This data set is another practice script to explore the UFO dataset from the data.world.
If you are curious about the data set, you can download it here: https://data.world/aarranzlopez/ufo-sights-2016-us-and-canada
 In this example, instead of using the read_csv method in pandas, I will be using the read_excel method.

 You will need to install the following modules in order to run this script. 

- pip3 install xlrd
- pip3 install wheel
